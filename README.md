# Introduction

Slash16 is a network of people passionate about system and network administration and / or operational development (DevOps).
We also aim to allow a unification of knowledge between its
members through the implementation of joint projects, conferences, or any other activity relevant to the sharing of knowledge and professional experience.
This is why we decided to offer you two subjects:
• A subject of initiation (this one).
• A subject for creating a complete infrastructure.
With this, you will have the right to videos in your e-learning to understand the
basics you will need
